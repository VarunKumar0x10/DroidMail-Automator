# DroidMail-Automator
DroidMail-Automator is a lightweight, AI-powered productivity tool designed to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and mobile email clients. Built during a hackathon, it uses DroidRun to automate the preparation of professional email drafts on Android devices without the need for complex API integrations or SMTP configurations.
